  <h1 class="title">Five Tech Milestones</h1>
  <h2>ENIAC (1946)</h2>
  <p id="paragraph-1">The <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, or the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was created at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and developed by John Presper Eckert and John W.
    Mauchly. The university reported the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer as the “first general-purpose electronic computer.” ENIAC’s “operational characteristics” contained memory and arithmetic.
    The ENIAC was planned out and constructed for the use of United States Army to calculate artillery firing tables. In 1946 the ENIAC was announced and made the creative imagination of the public excited for they called the ENIAC a “giant brain.”
    A recent smartphone weighs a few ounces and is small enough to slip into a pocket, but in 1946, the ENIAC weighed 30 tons and used up the space of about 1,800 square feet.
    The ENIAC was funded by the United States Army, Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon M. Barnes. The total cost was about $487,000, which is the same as $7,051,000 in 2018.

  <h2>IBM's PC (1981)</h2>
  <p>In August 1981, <a href="http://www.oldcomputers.net/ibm5150.html">IBM</a> produced its own personal computer (PC). IBM’s personal computer was not the fist for many came before theirs, but their personal computer set the tone and became the
    model personal computer. The IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory and the total price was $1,565. The computer had many attributes such as a built-in speaker and the ability to run self-diagnostic checks.
    On the motherboard, five internal ISA expansion slots give the option to add additional memory and other capabilities, although one slot is normally taken by the video card, and another slot by the optional floppy drive controller. Usually an
    RS-232 serial port card is installed on the third slot. Another popular option was to add a modem card for dialing-up remote computer systems. While the original IBM 5150 PC was able to hold only 64K of RAM memory on the motherboard, later
    versions incorporated higher capacity memory chips, allowing up to 256K onboard and up to 640K with internal expansion cards.

  <h2>Apple's Macintosh (1984)</h2>
  <p>In January 1984, Steve Jobs launched the first <a href="https://parade.com/252656/viannguyen/the-mac-turns-30-how-much-is-the-original-computer-worth-today/">Macintosh</a>. The Apple co-founder presented many of the Macintosh’s features such as
    its ability to “talk” and a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images. Jobs had ambitious objectives for the product. “Macintosh is targeted at two primary markets. The first is the 25 million ‘knowledge workers’ who sit
    behind desks, and particularly those in medium and small-sized businesses. And the second market is the college worker, we think that’s the knowledge worker of tomorrow and there are over 11 million college students in America alone.”
    It had a nine-inch screen and costed $2,500.
    The computer had a black-and-white display, two serial ports, and a slot for one 3.5-inch floppy disc. It was showed during a memorable commercial that aired during Super Bowl XVIII. Apple had sold 50,000 of them three months later.
    It was an incredible piece of technology then and more than 30 years later, Apple computers are still at the top of tech.

  <h2>The World Wide Web (1989)</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/08/06/20-years-ago-today-the-world-wide-web-opened-to-the-public/">World Wide Web</a> became accessible to the public on 6 August 1991. Tim Berners-Lee, the man who is known across the globe is
    its creator. Tim Berners-Lee produced a new technology which would completely change the world as we knew it.
    The World Wide Web began from the work that Berners-Lee did in the 1980s at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. He had been searching for an efficient way for physicists to exchange information around the world without everyone
    using the same selections of hardware and software. This peaked in his 1989 paper suggesting ‘A large hypertext database with typed links’.
    Although the first proposal didn’t to collect much momentum within CERN, it was later made into a more concrete document suggesting a World Wide Web of documents, connected through hypertext links. World Wide Web was taken as the project’s name
    following denied possibilities such as ‘The Mine of Information’ and "The Information Mesh". The May 1990 proposal presented the idea of the Web.

  <h2>The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation (1994)</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/sega-saturn-how-one-decision-destroyed-playstations-greatest-rival">The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation</a> consoles created a path in the video gaming industry which were launched
    within weeks of one another. Although the PlayStation has lasted longer than the Saturn through several repetitions, including today’s PlayStation 4, both consoles had a huge effect and influence on home entertainment.
    Sega Mega Drive and other alike consoles, games for the Saturn and PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges, unlike the Super Nintendo. The consoles had enough power within to showcase games containing the visually stunning “Nights into
    Dreams” on the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII,” an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation.
    The company’s chief system designer went to see developers around the world, taking a remarkable set of graphics demos and promising a wealth of neat development tools and satisfactory production deals. Sega had been confusing and isolating its
    audience and development community with a thread of additions for the enormously successful Mega Drive in the meantime.
